# Advance Face Recognition Employee/Students Attendance System Project in Python OpenCV with
Tkinter GUI & MySQL Database. 

# Technology Used : Python 3.7, CV2, Database is MySQL
## The Below Algorithm for Face Detection has been used

1.     Haarcascade Opencv (Object Detection)

2.     Haarcascade Eye

3.     Haarcascade Smile

4.      LBPH OpenCV (Face Recognition)

## Features of Project:

1.      Login Security System (Username & Password)

2.      Home Page

3.      Employee/Student management system (Save, Take Photo Samples,    Update, Delete, Clear)

4.      100 sample photos taken for Employee/Students

5.      Based on these 100 sample photos data is train

6.      Take Attendance with Face Detection, in-time and out-time

7.      Face Detection uses the train data set to detect the face and mark their attendance.

8.      Attendance Report (CSV/Excel file & MySQL database)
